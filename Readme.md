# Expanding and collapsing master rows


<p>This sample shows you a few members that allow to expand and collapse master rows. Keyboard presses are processed to allow the CTRL+* shortcut to toggle the currently focused master row's state. There are also two buttons - one allowing to expand all master rows, and another that collapses details for all but the focused row.</p>
